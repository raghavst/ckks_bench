# FIDESlib

A server-side CKKS GPU library fully interoperable with OpenFHE.

## Quickstart Custom Benchmarking Guide
This is mainly a clone of the PhantomFHE library. Commit used (latest at the 
time): 85b7d08cc6c564bf0f07b037ad1619b406cf3253.

Run the benchmarks using the following commands:
```
cmake -S . -B build -DFIDESLIB_INSTALL_OPENFHE=ON # create build files. May need to use sudo
cmake --build build --target custom_benchmark -j # build only the custom benchmark to save time. May need to use sudo
./build/custom_benchmark --benchmark_time_unit=us # run the benchmarks and display the results in microseconds
```

## Features
  -  Full CKKS implementation: Add, AddPt, AddScalar, Mult, MultPt, MultScalar, Square, Rotate, RotateHoisted, Bootstrap.
  -  OpenFHE interoperability for FIXEDMANUAL, FIXEDAUTO, FLEXIBLEAUTO and FLEXIBLEAUTOEXT.
  -  Hardware acceleration with Nvidia CUDA.
  -  High-performance NTT/INTT implementation.
  -  Hybrid Key-Switching.

## Compilation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requirements:
>  -  Nvidia CUDA  version 12 or greater.
>  -  GNU GCC Compiler version 10 or greater.
>  -  CMake version 3.25.2 or greater.
>  -  (Optional) Intel Thread Building Blocks for faster context creation.

> [!NOTE]
> Some dependencies will be automatically downloaded if needed:
> - GoogleTest: used by our test suite.
> - GoogleBenchmark: used by our benchmark suite.

In order to be able to compile the project, one must follow these steps:

  - Clone this repository.
  - Generate the makefiles with CMake.
  ```bash
  cmake -B $PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR -S $PATH_TO_THIS_REPO --fresh 
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DFIDESLIB_INSTALL_OPENFHE=ON
  ```
  - Build the project.
  ```bash
  cmake --build $PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR -j
  ```

FIDESlib needs a patched version of OpenFHE in order to be able to access some internals needed for interoperability. This patched version can be automatically installed by defining FIDESLIB_INSTALL_OPENFHE=ON CMake variable. By default this variable is set OFF.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently custom installation paths for patched OpenFHE are not supported. OpenFHE will be installed on the default path specified in their build files and you will probably need to run the build files generation command with administrator privileges.

The build process produces the following artifacts: 
- fideslib.a: The FIDESlib library to be statically linked to any client application.
- fideslib-test: The test suite executable.
- fideslib-bench: The benchmark suite executable.
- gpu-test: A dummy executable to search for the CUDA capable devices on the machine.
- dummy: Another dummy executable.

> [!WARNING]
> Compiling FIDESlib sometimes produces TLS-related errors. This issue can be addressed by re-compiling OpenFHE in debug mode. In this case, you should:
> - Manually clone [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) and, with git, apply openfhe-hook.patch and openfhe-base.patch. 
> - Generate the build files with CMake using Debug as build type.
> - Compile and install OpenFHE on the machine. 

## Installation

Installing the library is as easy as running the following command:

```bash
cmake --build $PATH_TO_BUILD_DIR --target install -j
```

FIDESlib is currently ready to be consumed as a CMake library. The template project on the examples directory shows how to build and run a FIDESlib client application and contains examples of usage of most of the functionality provided by FIDESlib. Currently client applications consuming FIDESlib should use the CUDA compiler every time they include a FIDESlib header.

> [!NOTE]
> As the default installation prefix is /usr/local. All installed headers should be located under /usr/local/include/FIDESlib, the CMake package files under /usr/local/share/FIDESlib and the compiled library under /usr/local/lib.

> [!WARNING]
> FIDESlib currently does not support custom installation paths. One should run the installation command with administrator priviledges.
